## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned how to use calc() function to set the height of the body. I struggled to set the height because there have margin around them (box-sizing: border-box not work obviously)
- Also I used background-size: contain instead of "cover" (which i used all the time)

### Useful resources

- [calc() function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVKwluRTfo&t=630s) - I learned some tip about calc function in this video
